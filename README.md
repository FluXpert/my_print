# My Print
myPrint is the way to use DEBUG PRINT in a good manner.

## Reason
Many of the developers uses ```print("Data...");``` method to check the values which harms the release by printing those values in it. So, use "myPrint" using this package to secure your app.
This is designed ```debugPrint("Data...")``` function..
